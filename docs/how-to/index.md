# How-to Guides

How-to guides are **task-oriented** recipes that guide you through the steps to solve specific problems. They assume you already have a working grid and want to accomplish something specific.

## Who are how-to guides for?

How-to guides are for developers who **know what they want to do** but need to know how. Unlike tutorials, they don't teach concepts—they show you how to complete a task.

## What makes a good how-to guide?

- **Focused**: Solves one specific problem
- **Practical**: Shows real, working code
- **Flexible**: Explains options and trade-offs
- **Complete**: Includes all necessary steps
