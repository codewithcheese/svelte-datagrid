# Explanation

Explanation documentation is **understanding-oriented**. It provides context, discusses concepts, and helps you understand how and why things work the way they do.

## Who is explanation documentation for?

Explanation is for developers who want to **understand the bigger picture**. If you're wondering "why does it work this way?" or "how do these pieces fit together?", explanation documentation will help.

## What makes good explanation documentation?

- **Contextual**: Provides background and history
- **Conceptual**: Focuses on understanding, not doing
- **Alternative-aware**: Discusses trade-offs and other approaches
- **Connected**: Shows how concepts relate to each other

## Reading order

If you're new to the codebase architecture:

1. Start with [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) for the big picture
2. Read [State Management](./state-management.md) to understand reactivity
3. Explore [Virtualization](./virtualization.md) for rendering strategy
4. Study [Data Source Architecture](./data-source-architecture.md) for data layer

These topics build on each other, so reading in order will give you the best understanding.
